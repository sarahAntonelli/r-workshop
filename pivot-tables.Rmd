## Attach libraries

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)
library(skimr) # install.packages("skimr")

```

## Read in our data

Our data is about lobsters

```{r}

lobsters <- read_excel(here("R-workshop-data", "lobsters.xlsx"))

```

Explore our data

```{r}
# head() function shows the first 6 lines of data
head(lobsters)

# summary() to give a summary of each column
summary(lobsters)

## skimr::skim() gives additional summary statitics and is pipable ( %>% )
skim(lobsters)

# ggplot of lobsters
ggplot(data = lobsters, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~site)
```

## Our task:

How has the average size of lobsters changed over time across sites?

```{r}
